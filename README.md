## Voting Systems Explained 📚

### 1. **First Past the Post (FPTP)**
   - Each voter selects one candidate.
   - The candidate with the most votes wins.

### 2. **Approval Voting**
   - Each voter can approve as many candidates as they like.
   - The candidate with the most approvals wins.

### 3. **Preferential Voting**
   - Voters rank candidates in order of preference.
   - Votes are counted in rounds, eliminating the least popular candidate each round until a majority winner is found.

### 4. **Condorcet Method**
   - Voters rank candidates in order of preference.
   - The winner is the candidate who beats every other candidate in pairwise comparisons.

### 5. **Borda Count**
   - Voters rank candidates in order of preference.
   - Candidates are awarded points based on their rank, and the candidate with the highest total points wins.
